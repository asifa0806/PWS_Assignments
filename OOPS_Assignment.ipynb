        "\n",
        "ans-  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. It is used to design software by modeling real-world entities as objects that contain both data (attributes/properties) and behavior (methods/functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Principles of OOP: 1)Encapsulation – Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a class while restricting direct access to some details. 2)Abstraction – Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential functionalities. 3)Inheritance – Allowing a class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent), promoting code reusability. 4)Polymorphism – Allowing objects to take multiple forms, meaning a single function can work differently based on the object it is acting upon.\n",

        "\n",
        "**2. What is a class in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods/functions) that the objects of that class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Features of a Class: 1) Encapsulation – Groups related data and functions together. 2) Abstraction – Hides implementation details from the user. 3) Inheritance – Allows a new class to derive properties and behavior from an existing class. 4) Polymorphism – Enables a single interface to represent different types\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with attributes (data) and behaviors (methods/functions) defined by its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Characteristics of an Object: 1) State – Represented by attributes (variables). 2) Behavior – Defined by methods (functions inside the class). 3) Identity – Each object has a unique identity in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer- 1) Abstraction- It is a feature of OOPs. It is used to hide the unnecessary information or data from the user but shows the essential data that is useful for the user. It can be achieved by using the interface and the abstract class. In interfaces, only the methods are exposed to the end-user. Encapsulation- It is also a feature of OOP. It is used to bind up the data into a single unit called class. It provides the mechanism which is known as data hiding. It is an important feature of OOPs. It prevents to access data members from the outside of the class. It is also necessary from the security point of view.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer- Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Inheritance is a fundamental OOP concept that allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent/superclass). It promotes code reuse, extensibility, and hierarchical relationships between classes. Type Of Inheritance 1️⃣ Single Inheritance (One class inherits from another) 2️⃣ Multiple Inheritance (One class inherits from multiple classes) 3️⃣ Multilevel Inheritance (Inheritance chain) 4️⃣ Hierarchical Inheritance (Multiple classes inherit from a single parent) 5️⃣ Hybrid Inheritance (Combination of multiple types)\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages of Inheritance ✅ Code Reusability – Avoids duplication by reusing existing code. ✅ Extensibility – Enhances existing functionality without modifying the parent class. ✅ Maintainability – Easier to manage and update code. ✅ Polymorphism – Allows different classes to use a common interface.\n",

        "Answer- Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Polymorphism means \"many forms\" and allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were objects of a common superclass. It enables one interface to be used for different data types and allows methods to be used interchangeably across multiple classes. Types of Polymorphism 1️⃣ Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism) When a child class redefines a method from the parent class with the same name and parameters 2️⃣ Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism) [Not Native in Python] In some languages (like Java & C++), multiple methods in the same class can have the same name but different parameters. Python does not support method overloading natively, but it can be mimicked using default arguments. 3️⃣ Operator Overloading Allows us to change the behavior of operators (+, -, *, etc.) for custom objects. 4️⃣ Polymorphism with Functions and Objects A function can accept multiple types of objects that share a common method.\n",

        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal state of an object and requiring all interactions to be performed through an object’s methods. This approach: 1)Provides better control over data. 2)Prevents accidental modification of data. 3)Promotes modular programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "How Encapsulation Works : 1) Data Hiding: The variables (attributes) are kept private or protected, meaning they are not accessible directly from outside the class. Instead, they can only be accessed or modified through the methods. 2) Access through Methods: Methods act as the interface through which external code interacts with the data stored in the variables. For instance, getters and setters are common methods used to retrieve and update the value of a private variable. 3)Control and Security: By encapsulating the variables and only allowing their manipulation via methods, the class can enforce rules on how the variables are accessed or modified, thus maintaining control and security over the data.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer- Method overloading in Python refers to defining multiple methods in a class with the same name but different arguments. However, Python does not support traditional method overloading like Java or C++ because Python functions can accept a variable number of arguments using default parameters, args, and *kwargs. 1)Simulated Method Overloading in Python: Instead of defining multiple methods with the same name, you can use conditional checks inside a single method. 2)Using *args for Overloading: You can use *args to handle a variable number of arguments 3)Using @singledispatch for True Overloading: Python's functools.singledispatch allows function overloading based on argument type.\n",

        "Abstraction: OOP enables you to represent complex systems using simpler, abstract models. You can define classes that represent real-world entities without needing to describe every detail, allowing for easier understanding and management of the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: OOP supports inheritance, which lets you create new classes based on existing ones. This promotes code reusability, as common functionality can be implemented in a parent class and inherited by child classes. It also helps in creating a hierarchical classification of classes.\n",
